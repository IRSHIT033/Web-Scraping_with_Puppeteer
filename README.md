# Web-Scraping with PUPPETEER

In the project directory , you can run:
### `npm start`


In this project I am scraping data from "coinmarket.com"  by using puppeteer npm package . You can put your own url and scrap it .If you want to scrap another website's data you have to change "url " variable string and also  the '$eval' function's first parameter and set it with classes or ids of html tags in the website that you wanna scrap.

with puppeteer you can also automate your website.
