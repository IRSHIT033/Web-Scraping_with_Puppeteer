# Web-Scraping with PUPPETEER

In the project directory , you can run:
### `npm start`


In this project I am scraping data from "coinmarket.com"  by using puppeteer npm package . You can put your own url and scrap it .If you want to scrap another website you have to change  the '$eval' first parameter and set it with classes or ids of html tags in that website's data that you wanna scrap.
